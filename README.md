Myntra Clone Project

Welcome to my first project - a clone of the Myntra website using CSS and HTML.This project aims to replicate the look and feel of the popular online fashion retailer, Myntra, using basic web development technologies.This project is a static website that mimics the homepage of Myntra. The primary focus of this project is to practice and demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS.The project includes various elements typically found on an e-commerce site such as a navigation bar, product listings, promotional banners, and a footer.

The project is inspired by the Myntra website.Special thanks to the creators of online CSS tutorials and documentation that greatly assisted in the development of this project by Prashant Sir(@KG Coding with Prashant Sir).Thanks to the numerous online resources and tutorials that provided guidance and inspiration for this project.I try to add more feature than i learnt in tutorial.
